Code challenge for ThirdLove

## Code execution
You will have to inject CSS and JS code directly to this PDP page (https://www.thirdlove.com/products/24-7-classic-t-shirt-bra-taupe), you could use some code injection extension like **User Javascript and CSS** (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld) to test/show the code. In the *main.js* file is the JS code to paste on the JS tab of the extension and on the *style.css* is the CSS code to paste on the CSS tab.
